<pre><b><font size="2"><font face="Arial Black">Introduction</font></font></b>

It is a well know fact that the Short Term Insurance Industry loses Millions of Rand 
per year due to being overcharged by some Panelbeaters for new parts replacements, but in 
actual fact used parts are used. This can almost never be proofed after the car has 
been repaired. It is also a major problem in the Industry that some Assessors are on the 
take and millions are lost due to irregularities. This is why A.C.I. was formed with 
over 32 years of experience between the 2 founding members to help eliminate this problem 
and losses. A.C.I. is a registered PTY (Ltd) Company formed in 2005.

<font face="Arial Black">A.C.I. Purpose</font>

<font face="Arial Black">How does it work?</font>

The Insurer/Underwriter sends the claims details by e-mail or fax to A.C.I. after the 
Assessor has assessed the vehicle and repairs been authorized. A.C.I. inspects the 
vehicle at the repair shop not less than twice during the repair proses. A.C.I. 
inspects authenticity of spare, quality of craftsmanship. A.C.I. agrees a saving on 
the job complete with the Panelbeater. A full report is drafted after each claim, 
including photos and documentation; this report is then forwarded to the 
Insurer/Underwriter. A.C.I. expects its payment when the claims are
settled with the panelbeater. A.C.I. is paid and fixed pre-arranged fee on each claim 
and a percentage of the savings off original quote. 

<font face="Arial Black">ACI -Manager</font>

ACI has developed and introduced an Internet bases system; witch handles the complete 
process of a claim. With this system anyone can be given access to monitor the claims 
process and status of the claim at any given time. This way anyone know exactly what 
is happening with the claim at any stage of the process. With the system, the client 
can log a claim, claims technicians can accept and process the claim, appoint assessors
(per region), handle and complete assessors report, do invoicing on behalf of assessor,
do automatic authorization instructions, request final costing from panelbeaters, 
handle final costing from panelbeaters, send final invoice to insurer. 

<b><font face="Arial Black">Conclusion</font></b>

There is no additional cost or expense to the Insurer/Underwriter, only a percentage of 
the actual cost saver on each claim. This is a win-win situation. This method will keep 
the all parties involved  on a higher stadard off service and honesty. Over time less and
less advantages will be taken in the  industry, witch will make help maintain a higher
degree of professionalism.
